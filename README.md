If this doesn't work and it says to download VS Studio go to this website and download VS Studio: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
Once downloaded check "Desktop development with C++" and only check "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86" and "Windows 11 SDK(10.0.22621.0)"
Once those install restart your PC and follow steps 7-11 on this link: https://github.com/bycloudai/InstallVSBuildToolsWindows
After all this you should be able to run the program!
